    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy tomato soup is a timeless dish that's soothing, a bit tangy, and with a lively hue. In this recipe, caramelizing the onions and garlic deepens the flavor, while thick cream enriches the soup's luxurious texture.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 head garlic</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable stock or chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons agave syrup</li>
        <li>8 sprigs fresh basil, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>8 sprigs fresh oregano, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet sheet with cooking spray. Place garlic bulb and onion on the prepared sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast until very tender, 40 to 45 minutes; remove from oven and let cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Chop half the onion; release 4 garlic cloves. Set aside remaining onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped roasted onions and 4 roasted garlic cloves to the hot oil, and cook and stir until fragrant, up to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add both cans of San Marzano tomatoes (including juice), vegetable stock, and agave syrup. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer tomatoes and some of the liquid, remaining onion, remaining garlic, fresh basil, and fresh oregano into a food processor or blender. Blend until there are no chunks.</li>
        <li>Add soup mixture back into the Dutch oven along with heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer on low to medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld together.</li>  
    </ol>
