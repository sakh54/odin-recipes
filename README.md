# odin-recipes

This is the first project from the HTML lesson in The Odin Project. The skills demonstrated in this project include building the website homepage (index.html) and individual recipe pages. It also included the HTML boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images. After building the pages, I used the command line to publish the project to GitHub.
